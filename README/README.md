# Practical Repository

## Welcome!

Hey there! Welcome to my practicals repository for CP1404. This repo is a collection of various assignments and projects I've worked on throughout the course. Each folder and file here represents a piece of the journey I've been on in learning and applying software development concepts.

## About Me

Hi! I’m Jessica UHIRIWE, a student diving into the world of coding through these practicals. This repository showcases my hands-on experience with different programming techniques and best practices. I hope you find this as interesting and insightful as I do!

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

Here are a few key takeaways I've learned about writing clean code:

- **Clarity:** It's crucial to write code that others and myself can easily understand. This means using descriptive variable names, avoiding complex code blocks, and making sure my code’s logic is straightforward.
- **Consistency:** Keeping a consistent style throughout my codebase is essential. This includes following naming conventions, sticking to a formatting style, and adhering to coding standards.
- **Modularity:** Breaking down my code into small, reusable pieces makes it easier to manage and test. It also helps in keeping my code organized and makes future updates less cumbersome.
- **Avoiding Repetition with Inheritance:** One of the major lessons I’ve learned is the importance of avoiding repetitive code. Using inheritance effectively allows you to create a base class with common functionality and then extend it in derived classes.
- **Effective Use of Classes**:  Group related data and functions into classes to keep my code organized and avoid repeating myself. This way, I can build on existing functionality through inheritance, which makes my code more reusable and easier to manage.
