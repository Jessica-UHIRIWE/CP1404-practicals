How was your estimate accuracy usually?
- The accuracy of my estimates typically varied. While some estimates were quite close to the actual outcomes, others were off by a significant margin, depending on the complexity of the task and the amount of available information.

How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
- Throughout the course, my estimate accuracy generally improved. By reflecting on previous estimates and comparing them to actual results, I was able to refine my approach. Learning to break down tasks into smaller components and understanding the impact of different variables contributed to more accurate estimates. 

What did you learn from doing these estimates?
- I learned that estimating requires a balance between experience, data analysis, and adaptability. It taught me the importance of considering various factors and potential risks when making estimates. Additionally, I discovered the value of reviewing and learning from past estimates to improve future accuracy.
