What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
- Watch the videos more than before and I have started working on my practicals before the deadline for me to understand what I am doing.

What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
- I need to practise more about the use of version control and check the rubric guide on marking to understand what I should include in my work and what I am asked to do.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
- Seeking guidance and the willingness to put in effort to learn new things even when it seems a lot.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
- I need to stop practising the work last minute but do my revision and put in more work.

What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
- I would prefer if local lecturers had full control over everything related to our coursework and grades. Often, there are unexpected changes in our grades, and when we seek clarification, the local lecturers are unable to provide answers as the subject coordinators are in control.
- For Programming II, we would appreciate a revision class that summarizes all the content we've covered during the trimester, ideally before the exam.
- Lastly, we would like our lecturers to provide us with detailed feedback on our work, highlighting areas for improvement and offering general guidance.
